    <br/>A first you moved,

    <br/>only a little.

    <br/>I could always find you,

    <br/>right in the middle.

    <br/>As time went on,
    
    <br/>you really started to grow.

    <br/>It wasn’t a whole lot,

    <br/>in fact, it was rather slow.

    <br/>Before I knew it,

    <br/>you were all over the place.

    <br/>It kind of felt like

    <br/>you were running a race.

    <br/>People would ask me

    <br/>if you were a boy .

    <br/>I would sit and wonder,

    <br/>if you would have curls.

    <br/>There are so many things

    <br/>I really want to know.

    <br/>But you are hidden inside,

    <br/>so the answers don’t show.

    <br/>How much will you weigh?

    <br/>How tall will you be?

    <br/>What color is your hair?

    <br/>Will you even like me?

    <br/>I hope and pray

    <br/>you feel like you belong.

    <br/>I never want you to feel

    <br/>like you are alone.

    <br/>Your dad and I

    <br/>planned you from the start.

    <br/>You, my dear child,

    <br/>  were made straight from our hearts.

    <br/>In about a week or so,

    <br/>I’ll meet you, for the first time.

    <br/>For you are the product

    <br/>of your dad’s love and mine.

    <br/>There will be no one like you,

    <br/>not any place in the world.

    <br/>It really doesn’t matter

    <br/>if you are a boy .

    <br/>We are both so happy

    <br/>that you even exist.

    <br/>The gender doesn’t matter.

    <br/>you’ll be hard to resist.

    <br/>I hope I make you proud,

<br/>that I am your mother every day.

<br/>Because, you have filled my dreams

<br/>in more ways than words can say.

<br/>It won’t be long before

<br/>I can look you in the eyes.

<br/>I can feel the excitement growing,

<br/>I know I’m going to cry.

<br/>Don’t worry my angel,

<br/>those tears will be of joy.

<br/>It won’t matter to me

<br/>if you are a girl or a boy.</body>
